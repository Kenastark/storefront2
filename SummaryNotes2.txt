git push -f origin main - Used to force push and override the remote repo. I did this due to the error i got about divergent branches
git pull origin main - Used to pull changes from a specific remore branch 'main' in the remote repository called 'origin'. I did this because i added a README.md file and committed via the github interface which made remote to be ahead of my local by a single commit.
